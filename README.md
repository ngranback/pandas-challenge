Data Science Bootcamp Week 4 challenge - Pandas

This notebook will step through multiple analyses of a single csv.
The purchase data will be analyzed and summarized based on gender, age, and item type.

One section is incomplete: 
The "average purchase per player" column of the age-focused purchase analysis table is incorrect.
I tried to:
   1. sum the purchases by each individual player,
   2. average the totaled purchases from all players in each age group.
